# CONTEXT #
The 'solve_query' function is a Python function that takes an image as input and returns an answer to a <<QUERY>> in a string format.

# OBJECTIVE #
Create a Python function named `execute_test` that checks the correctness of the `solve_query` function using the given <<QUERY>>.
<<EXAMPLES>> are the in-context examples.
Include up to four test cases, each with the comment `# Test case n:` above the assert statement, starting from 1.
Consider these guidelines when creating the test cases:
1. Keep in mind that the return values do not contain numbers.
2. If the Query is True or False questions, the return values will be yes or no.
3. If the Query gives options using "or", the return values will be one of the options.
4. Use the llm_query function to answer informational questions not concerning the image.

# STYLE #
technical, in a correct Python format

# TONE #
clear, precise, professional

# AUDIENCE #
Developers and engineers who will use the test functions to verify the correctness of the solve_query function

# RESPONSE #
Provide the function that start with 'def execute_test(image)' without any explanation.
Each test case should be commented with `#Test case n:` where `n` represents the test case number.

###
Here are some <<EXAMPLES>>:
Query: Is the shape of the table round or square?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    # Query gives two options, so the result should be one of them
    assert result in ['round', 'square'], "Expected output to be round or square"
    return result
###
Query: How tall is the oven in the bottom of the photo?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert result in ['tall', 'short'], "Expected output to be tall or short"
    # Test case 2:
    assert not any(char.isdigit() for char in result), "Expected output to not have numbers"
    return result
###
Query: What is the person on the bed holding?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert isinstance(result, str), "Expected output to be string."
    # Test case 2:
    assert len(result.split()) in [1,2], "Expected output to be one or two words"
    # Test case 3:
    assert llm_query(f"Can you hold {result}?", long_answer=False) == 'yes', "Expected output to be an object you can hold"
    return result
###
Query: What is the toy made of wood placed on top of?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert isinstance(result, str), "Expected output to be string."
    # Test case 2:
    assert len(result.split()) in [1,2], "Expected output to be one or two words"
    return result
###
Query: How large are the strawberries that are on top of the shortcake?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert result in ['large', 'small'], "Expected output to be large or small"
    # Test case 2:
    assert not any(char.isdigit() for char in result), "Expected output to not have numbers"
    return result
###
Query: Which kind of clothing is not black?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert isinstance(result, str), "Expected output to be string."
    # Test case 2:
    assert len(result.split()) in [1,2], "Expected output to be one or two words"
    # Test case 3:
    assert llm_query(f"Is {result} a kind of clothing?", long_answer=False) == 'yes', "Expected output to be a kind of clothing"
    return result
###
Query: How does the window look, closed or open?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    # Query gives two options, so the result should be one of them
    assert result in ['closed', 'open'], "Expected output to be closed or big"
    return result
###
Query: What is the piece of furniture that the luggage that is in front of people?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert isinstance(result, str), "Expected output to be string."
    # Test case 2:
    assert len(result.split()) in [1,2], "Expected output to be one or two words"
    # Test case 3:
    assert llm_query(f"Is {result} a piece of furniture?", long_answer=False) == 'yes', "Expected output to be a piece of furniture"
    return result
###
Query: Does the cups look blue or red?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    # Query gives two options, so the result should be one of them
    assert result in ['blue', 'red'], "Expected output to be blue or red"
    return result
###
Query: Is the boat by the dock wooden and old?

def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert result in ['yes', 'no'], "Expected output to be yes or no."
    return result
