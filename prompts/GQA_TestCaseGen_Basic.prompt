# CONTEXT #
The 'solve_query' function is a Python function that takes an image as input and returns an answer to a <<QUERY>> in a string format.

# OBJECTIVE #
Create a Python function named `execute_test` that checks the correctness of the `solve_query` function using the given <<QUERY>>.
<<EXAMPLES>> are the in-context examples.
Include up to four test cases, each with the comment `# Test case n:` above the assert statement, starting from 1.
Consider these guidelines when creating the test cases:
1. Return values of the solve_query function will be string with one or two words, not having numbers.
2. If the Query is True or False questions, the return values will be yes or no.
3. If the Query gives options using "or", the return values will be one of the options.
4. Do not give list of possible answers unless it is explicitly mentioned in the query.

# STYLE #
technical, in a correct Python format

# TONE #
clear, precise, professional

# AUDIENCE #
Developers and engineers who will use the test functions to verify the correctness of the solve_query function

# RESPONSE #
Provide the function that start with 'def execute_test(image)' without any explanation.
Each test case should be commented with `#Test case n:` where `n` represents the test case number.

###
Here are some <<EXAMPLES>>:

Query: Is the pillow boo or foo?
A:
def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    # Query gives two options using "or", so the output should be one of the options.
    assert result in ['boo','foo'], "Expected output to be boo or foo."
    return result
###
Query: Is there foo or bee in the image?
A:
def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert result in ['yes', 'no'], "Expected output to be yes or no."
    return result
###
Query: What is next to the boo?
A:
def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert result != 'boo', "Expected output not to be 'boo'."
    # Test case 2:
    assert isinstance(result, str), "Expected output to be string."
    return result
###
Query: How tall is the baz in the bottom of the photo?
A:
def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert result in ['tall', 'short'], "Expected output to be tall or short"
    # Test case 2:
    assert not any(char.isdigit() for char in result), "Expected output to not have numbers"
    return result
###
Query: What color of the object next to foo?
A:
def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
    # Test case 1:
    assert isinstance(result, str), "Expected output to be string."
    # Test case 2:
    assert len(result.split()) in [1,2], "Expected output to be one or two words"
    # Do not give list of possible answers since it is explicitly not mentioned in the query.
    return result
###
Query: Who is walking next to the dog?
A:
def execute_test(image):
    result = solve_query(image)
     # Test case 1:
    assert isinstance(result, str), "Expected output to be string."
    # Test case 2:
    assert len(result.split()) in [1,2], "Expected output to be one or two words"
    return result
###
# Instruction #
Generate the the function execute_test for the following query:
<<Query>>: INSERT_QUERY_HERE
